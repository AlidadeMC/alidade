## Why make Alidade?

The Minecraft community has made countless seed mapping tools and
libraries such as Chunkbase, Mineatlas, and Amidst. These tools work
great on the desktop, and they will likely suffice for you. However, they
don't address or solve the things I look for in an seed map app for my
personal use cases, which include:

- A native app that works across Mac, iPhone, and iPad, tuned for each
  platform, respectively
- Pinning common or favorite locations I visit frequently
- Deep integrations into the Apple ecosystem
- A "file over app" approach, where pinned locations, worlds I explore
  frequently, etc., are all save in a simple JSON file
  
Alidade isn't being built to strictly _compete_ with the other tools
out there, but it exists as an addition to that market.
