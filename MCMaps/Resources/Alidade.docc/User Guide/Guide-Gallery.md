## Overview

The Gallery view is a new feature that allows you to see all the photos
you have added to your map across all your pins in one convenient place.
On macOS Sequoia and iOS/iPadOS 18, this appears as a photo stack icon in
the toolbar. Selecting this icon will open the gallery in a new window. On
macOS 26 Tahoe and iOS/iPadOS 26, the Gallery appears as a top-level tab,
but it can also be opened in a new window.

Selecting a photo brings it into focus with Quick Look, where you can mark
up and share that photo individually. You can also switch between
photos by swiping or using the arrow keys.

You can also adjust how photos appear in the gallery by toggling the
aspect ratio toggle in the toolbar.
