        do any of the following:
        
        - Press the +/- keys on the keyboard.
        - Scroll with the scroll wheel.
        - Pinch with two fingers on the trackpad.
    }
    @Tab("iPhone/iPad") {
        Swipe in any direction to move the map. To zoom in our out, pinch
        with two fingers.
    }
}


## Jump to a location

1. Tap or click on the search bar labeled **Go To...**.
2. Type the coordinate you'd like to jump to. For example, to head to
   (X=12, Z=31), type '`12, 31`'.
3. Select the **Jump Here** item that appears at the top of the search
   results.

### Switch between dimensions

Alidade supports displaying maps in the Overworld, Nether, and End
dimensions.

@TabNavigator {
    @Tab("Mac") {
        1. In the toolbar, click on the map icon.
        2. In the dropdown, select the dimension you'd like to view.
    }
    @Tab("iPhone and iPad") {
        1. Tap the map icon that appears on top of the map.
        2. In the menu, select the dimension you'd like to view.
    }
}

> Note: Some maps in other dimensions may not render correctly if the map's
> Minecraft version doesn't support that dimension and will instead
> display a solid color.

## Change the visual appearance of maps

Alidade uses a natural color scheme designed to closely resemble the real
environments in-game. However, some players may prefer to use the
traditional color schemes used by other tools like Amidst, Chunkbase, etc.

@TabNavigator {
    @Tab("Mac") {
        1. In the toolbar, click on the map icon.
        2. In the dropdown, select the **Natural Colors** entry.
    }
    @Tab("iPhone and iPad") {
        1. Tap the map icon that appears on top of the map.
        2. In the dropdown, select the **Natural Colors** entry.
    }
}

This setting is applied across the entire app, rather than a specific map.
