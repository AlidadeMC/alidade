## Overview

Alidade provides a system for pinning locations that players may want to
remember or come back to for various reasons. Pins can be given a name and
color, and players can write descriptions about specific pins, along with
providing screenshots of their world at those locations to personalize
pins.

> running on macOS 26 Tahoe and later or iOS/iPadOS 26 and later. To review

- Tags associated with the pin (the tag icon in the toolbar)

Once you are satisfied with your changes, press the checkmark button to
leave editing mode.

  in the toolbar.

These photos will also appear in your gallery under the **Gallery** tab.

In the Library tab, press and hold (or right click) on the pin you'd like
to remove and select **Remove** from the context menu.

> Important: Removing a pin from the library will also remove any
> associated photos. However, changes only take effect when you close or
> save the file.
