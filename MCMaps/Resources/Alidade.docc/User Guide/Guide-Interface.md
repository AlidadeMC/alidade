## Overview

Alidade 2025.2 introduces a brand new user interface that complements the
new Liquid Glass design on macOS 26 Tahoe and iOS/iPadOS 26. This new
design is consistent across iPhone, iPad, and Mac, making it even easier
to switch between platforms. This guide will show you how this new
interface is laid out and what to expect on each of the platforms.

> Note: This user guide page will show screenshots of the interface on
> iPad, but the same design structure will appear on iPhone and Mac,
> with a few key differences:
>
> - On Mac, the sidebar remains as a sidebar and cannot be collapsed into
>   a tab bar.
> - On iPhone, the tabs appear at the bottom of the screen. Pins that
>   appear in the Library section are housed under the **Library** tab.

## General structure

Alidade is organized into the following main tabs:

### Map

The Map tab displays the map along with any pins on it. The map works the
same as it did in Alidade 1.x, allowing you to adjust the size and pan
around. You can also adjust the dimension and appearance from the toolbar,
along with jumping to a specific location or creating a pin.

For more information on navigating the map, refer to
<doc:Guide-Navigation>.

### World

The World tab lets you quickly adjust world settings, such as the seed,
version, and any integrations with other Minecraft server services.

### Gallery

The Gallery tab shows a gallery view of all your photos across your pins.
Selecting a photo brings it into focus with Quick Look, where you can mark
up and share that photo individually. You can also switch between
photos by swiping or using the arrow keys.

> Tip: On iPad and Mac, you can also have the gallery appear as a new
> window by pressing and holding (or right-clicking) on the Gallery tab in
> the sidebar and selecting "Open in New Window" in the context menu.

### Search

The Search tab lets you search for biomes, structures, and pinned
locations. On iPhone, the search bar appears at the bottom; on iPad and
Mac, the search bar appears in the top right.

<doc:Guide-Search>.

### Library

The **Library** tab displays all your pins. You can have them display as
a list/table, or you can view them as a grid. On iPad and Mac, pins will
appear in the sidebar in the Library section, and you can customize which
ones to show or hide.

#### Pins

Selecting a pin from the Library (or from the sidebar on iPad and Mac)
will display a new page that shows the pin in detail, surfacing any notes
you have written along with gallery items. On iPad and Mac, a small map
showing where the pin is located is available as an inspector when
collapsing the sidebar.

The toolbar contains items for adding photos from both the Files
app/Finder and Photos, jumping to the current pin on the map in the Map
tab, and editing the current pin.

## Customization

On iPadOS, you can customize which tabs appear in the tab bar when you
collapse the sidebar. Simply tap the **Edit** button in the sidebar to
enter editing mode, then select what items you'd like to display. Drag
any tab bar items into the tab bar, or drag them out to unpin them.

## Menu bar items

Alidade includes new menu bar entries that appear on Mac and iPad, also
accessible as keyboard shortcuts:

- Under the **View** menu, you will find items to switch between the main
  tabs.
- The new **Map** menu provides items for jumping to a location, pinning
  your current location, and changing the appearance and map dimension.
