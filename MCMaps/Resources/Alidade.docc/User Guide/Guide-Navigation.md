## Move around the map

@TabNavigator {
    @Tab("Mac") {
        Click and drag in any direction to move the map. To zoom in or out,
        do any of the following:
        
        - Press the +/- keys on the keyboard.
        - Scroll with the scroll wheel.
        - Pinch with two fingers on the trackpad.
    }
    @Tab("iPhone/iPad") {
        Swipe in any direction to move the map. To zoom in our out, pinch
        with two fingers.
    }
}


## Jump to a location

While it is possible to head to a location by moving around the map
manually, Alidade offers a faster way of going to a specific location.

1. On the Map tab, press "Go To..." button in the toolbar (denoted by a
   figure walking) or go to **Map &rsaquo; Go To...** in the menu bar.
2. In the **Go To** form, type the X and Z coordinates for the location
   and press the checkmark button to confirm.

### Jump from a pin

You can also quickly jump to a pin from your library on iPadOS and macOS.
Simply swipe left on the pin you'd like to go to. Alternatively, press and
hold (or right click) on the pin and select **Go Here**.

### Switch between dimensions

Alidade supports displaying maps in the Overworld, Nether, and End
dimensions. On the Map tab, press the map icon in the toolbar, then select
the dimension you'd like to view. You can also access this from the
**Map** menu in the menu bar.

> Note: Some maps in other dimensions may not render correctly if the map's
> Minecraft version doesn't support that dimension and will instead
> display a solid color.

## Change the visual appearance of maps

Alidade uses a natural color scheme designed to closely resemble the real
environments in-game. However, some players may prefer to use the
traditional color schemes used by other tools like Amidst, Chunkbase, etc.

On the Map tab, press the map icon in the toolbar and de-select
**Natural Colors**. You can also access this from the **Map** menu in the
menu bar.

> Note: This setting is applied across the entire app, rather than
> a specific map.
