## Overview

This document is used to cover upcoming features and changes to Alidade
that aren't available in a particular release yet. These will change over
time as new versions and features are added.

### Map

- Maps will now group pins together in a cluster if they're close enough
  to each other. Player-crated pins will be clustered together in their
  own category; Bluemap death markers and Bluemap server markers are
  grouped in their own clusters, respectively.

### Pins

- Players can now select custom icons to use when displayed in the list
  and grid views in the library, along with their appearance on the map.
- In the Red Window design, players can now tap on a photo in the detail
  view for any pin to preview it in full detail.
